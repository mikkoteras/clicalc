# clicalc
clicalc is an interactive calculator run from a terminal.

Supports functions, smart evaluation order, variables, etc.

Implemented partly because I wanted to have this tool, but mostly to learn Rust. Feel free to comment, but please be aware that this is the first Rust program I've written and it probably looks a lot like C++ mangled into another language.
